Awebb: I wanna be deep without sounding deep. I wanna be like a city pigeon - dirty but able to fly.

Awebb: I have to admit that I use Windows boxes when work has to be done quickly. On any linux device, I tend to start tinkering with scripts and software, instead of using the tools I allready know to accomplish my goals.

Awebb: We have Debian in three flavors: old, rusty and stale.

johnraff: I switched to Linux in ~2005 when Microsoft dropped support for W98. The "moment" came about 6 months from then, when I suddenly realized that the software was on my side. On Windows I always seemed to be trying to get round what the system, and apps, were trying to make me do.

brontosaurusrex:
About the xy problem: "User doesn't know how to do X, but thinks they can fumble their way to a solution if they can just manage to do Y."
I don't really find that particularity interesting or funny, I would call that the default human behavior and the solution (when found) will:
- prevent future me to behave in the same way, so in itself is a (long-term) solution.
- doing Y did a lot of important discoveries (where X was declared uninteresting at the end)
- doing Y will/may raise common know-how
- doing Y will prevent dogmatic (single book) behaviors
- the direct solution to X (generally accepted dogma) may be so stupid, that it actually needs a better way with Y in between
- I could find a lot more here
Conclusion: xy problem does need a rewrite, since it misses the actual problem, heh

How brontosaurusrex introduces people to Linux: I tend to do a short GNU philosophy session (showing pictures of Stallman and Torvalds), especially pointing out that this is a HTML5 presentation and not Powerpoint. And the importance of free software. The questions are usually in the area of: will it run Photoshop faster?
%
ohnonot: When you have removed all choice and created a uniform system that can be used in one way only, when you have taken that freedom from the developers, too, that's when Linux becomes ready for mass adoption.
%
Bearded_Blunder: I have watched as it goes, & no amount of persuasion, presentations, arguments etc. are going to cause me to like it, any more than they'll make me like avacados (taste like soap), & don't care if the chef did spend many hours carving them into sailing ships, or how dedicated & talented he's alleged to be, avacados are still nasty & so is systemd.

- expecting you to formulate your question in a clever way, when you really don't know what and why you are actually asking;
- asking you to read tons of manuals and offering a multitude of solutions every time you ask a question you think is only short and simple;
- derailing and shooting every thread you start in outer space.
In short, the community is so helpful that in times you almost can't stand it.

brontosaurusrex: Also what people forget is that active politics requires enormous know-how about rules, documents, ways to navigate that mess, legal issues, various unknowns. Also a lot more time than one would think to make at least half-decent decisions (just to later realize that they were actually legally wrongly worded, or one is just over-voted). And if everything clicks perfectly the results are usually as tiny as if an ant would try to save the Titanic.

Then I serve it with Mexican cartel avacodo-spread. The mule who delivers my gluten injections and illegal avocados drives a Prius covered in flame-throwers!

BLizgreat!: If someone babbles enough (and yep, I clearly do) eventually they're bound to say something profound.

glittersloth: Never take vim seriously. Once you do, life get's turned upside down. You'll wonder why yy isn't yanking shit on someone else's text editor, you'll be totally lost when f doesn't show the link shortcuts on a browser without Vimium installed, and when playing an online game and everyone goes gg at the end for "good game", you'll be sitting there asking yourself why all these people want to scroll to the top of the chat console.
