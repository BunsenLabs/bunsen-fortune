%
Forthy: "(HoaS previously answered: Not at all but isn't it elegant?) - If you said that out loud in Anthony Head's voice it would be the actual finest reply to anything ever."
%
Awebb: I salute the nifty implications behind your curtain of irony.
%
Awebb: Since when is "Linux" part of some sort of popularity contest?
%
Awebb: Your box will die of kernel cancer!
%
Awebb: Command and Conky was the 90's, baby
%
Awebb: Hey, you successfully hijacked a thread! And noone sends you death wishes. Is this a nice place to stay or what?
%
Awebb: "Hey Awebb, where is your sense of humor?" you can't see it cuz it's cloaked as cynism.
%
Awebb: Your innocence and purity almost qualifies you as a sacrafice for the dragon that keeps attacking our village.
%
Awebb: Some call it nightly build, others call it mine field.
%
Awebb: I wanna be deep without sounding deep. I wanna be like a city pigeon - dirty but able to fly.
%
Awebb: I have to admit that I use Windows boxes when work has to be done quickly. On any linux device, I tend to start tinkering with scripts and software, instead of using the tools I allready know to accomplish my goals.
%
Awebb: Is finding out where the challenge is part of the challenge?
%
Awebb: We have Debian in three flavors: old, rusty and stale.
%
Awebb: Three completely distinct sentences in a paragraph, no facts, no conclusions. You are either very good in creating controversy or very bad in trolling.
%
Awebb: Nice work. This is why we love Linux. It starts with "I wonder..." and ends with hard work.
%
Awebb: This word "user-friendly" is used so often as if there was any common sense behind it.
%
Awebb: I thought this is about swearing using programming languages. Go fsck yourself.
%
Awebb: If you don't mind performance and the lack of elegance, you can pipe your initial commands behind each other.

machinebacon: Hello and welcome again to the damned forums, can you please post the shitty output of... (#samm)

el_koraco: I think OP has already moved to Arch. (#samm)
%
nathwill: i'm damn impressed. this thread is every bit as balls-numbingly epic as the f'ing title suggested. (The thread title was "Crunchbang slaughtered my data partition", later also known as "Slim ate my music")
%
gutterslob: Great... now the legislators are going to invent some newfangled law that forbids us normal folk from installing operating systems while driving.
I see a new, albeit somewhat niche market for hands-free OS install kits.
%
gutterslob: I left a comment on the page, typos included >__<
%
gutterslob: Happy GNU Year, my crunchies!!
%
gutterslob: - talking about the coming of #! 9.10 - Yeah, it'll probably be like Woodstock (minus the smell and the dandruff)
%
gutterslob about themselves on dA: Just remember to say it was done by "Some Random Drunken Minimalist Hobo"
%
gutterslob about their motorbike: She's rather materialistic and goes to flirt with my mechanic when she's mad. Bought her some nice carbon and titanium jewellery to keep her happy.
%
gutterslob: Me... all of me... giving my legendary pout while trying to look shy...
%
gutterslob: Openbox was never dead... it's just too cool to waste its time playing tag with the other WM and DE kids.
%
gutterslob: It's cute, but I don't really like cows.... they're slow and fart too much (the lawmakers should have banned cows instead of 2-stroke motorcycles!!) Try making one with a nimble, speedy animal (since #! is all about lightweight and speed).... maybe a cheetah or a mongoose
%
gutterslob: That looks rather biohazardous!... in a good way, I mean.
%
ohnonot: you ever heard a french dj saying eurythmics? - hhh: No, but when I do life will finally have meaning to it.
%
johnraff: I switched to Linux in ~2005 when Microsoft dropped support for W98. The "moment" came about 6 months from then, when I suddenly realized that the software was on my side. On Windows I always seemed to be trying to get round what the system, and apps, were trying to make me do.
%
antiv0rtex: I'm a teenager, and I certainly appreciate automatically-updating menus. Age is irrelevant.
%
ohnonot: yes, i totally agree with that, but no, this is not the problem here.
%
ohnonot: don't just connect to any passerby wifi. internet slut gets internet syphilis.
%
photonucleon: Not to be pedantic or nitpicking or just generally really nerdy... nore: What's wrong with that?
%
corenominal: I struggle to pronounce my forum name. gutterslob: So do we. That's why we call you Papanom. Rhymes with poppadom, so it also works up an appetite.
%
kbmonkey: kay-bee mun-kee - for 'keyboard' or 'keybored', depending on the eddy currents in the upper atmosphere.
%
pvsage: Mine is pronounced as two initials + a cooking herb: p v seɪdʒ
%
pa$$word: Well, you lot use Arch. I bleed enough on Debian stable.

brontosaurusrex:

About the xy problem: "User doesn't know how to do X, but thinks they can fumble their way to a solution if they can just manage to do Y."

I don't really find that particularity interesting or funny, I would call that the default human behavior and the solution (when found) will:
- prevent future me to behave in the same way, so in itself is a (long-term) solution.
- doing Y did a lot of important discoveries (where X was declared uninteresting at the end)
- doing Y will/may raise common know-how
- doing Y will prevent dogmatic (single book) behaviors
- the direct solution to X (generally accepted dogma) may be so stupid, that it actually needs a better way with Y in between
- I could find a lot more here

Conclusion: xy problem does need a rewrite, since it misses the actual problem, heh

nore: now I can leave yet another (new!) axe behind the dresser and sit in my rocking chair by the fire playing with conky.

glittersloth: Was that your kidney stone I just heard?

%
Panda: What can I say... I'm an American and grammatically disabled. ¤
%
ohnonot: what is it with terminal output that people seem to forget their ability to read? there's a reason for that output, and there's a reason that it's not in hex code, but in english.
%
glittersloth: Think I need to lay off the Mad Max references for a bit. Everyone around me seems so uptight these days.
%
nore: re-writing the sub-forums:
Basic help & support: "Don't panic."
System administration: "That quite definitely is the answer. I think the problem, to be quite honest with you, is that you've never actually known what the question is."
Topics Going Nowhere: "Resistance is futile."
Kernel & hardware: "WE APOLOGISE FOR THE INCONVENIENCE"
Off Topic: "There was a point to this story, but it has temporarily escaped the chronicler's mind."
%
glittersloth: Think it's bad now?! Just wait till the self-driving cars come along with driving skills "machine learned" from American soccer-moms and English footballers.
%
Sundaise: Can't get anything to work but I'm loving the experience!
%
nore: Modern UI: more wasted space on smaller and continually shrinking screens.
"If you want to proceed, hit the screen with your fist."
%
Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel: We learn from bash history that we do not learn from bash history.
%
twoion: So I wasn't wrong with my impression that hot coffee is always hot enough to reflow circuit boards :^)
%
Bearded_Blunder: When debian say "older machines" they mean "ancient".
%
pvsage: How hard did you facepalm when she said it? I think I might have broken my nose.
%
pvsage: If someone can point me to a study on touch typing with virtual keyboards that shows a better wpm vs. tpyo rate (typo intentional) over physical keyboards, please point me to it and I'll gladly buy a hat so that I can eat my hat.
%
Sector11: Guys guys... please. Sit back and OHM OHM OHM!

vrkalak: Posting this more for me so it is easy to find after Alzheimer's, Old Fart Disease, CRS, and Dementia kicks in later.
%
pvsage: I suspect that 1/n of a rocket ship would be more power than a full potato.
%
ohnonot: fork, fork, fork! the miraculous feeding of the multitude!
%
nore: Losing Xscreensaver is not a loss. It belongs to the not-so-glorious past like a colorful 90's shell suit.
%
Sector11: You are better than the nano man page!
%
pvsage: Agreed. Let's put them back in our pants, guys, none of us are impressing anyone.
%
pvsage about another quote in this repo: Nah, leave it in; just knowing it's there will serve as a reminder to watch what I post.

%
corenominal: P.S. I hope nobody takes any cues from me, ever.
%
glittersloth: I think the idea of the Olympics has been long dead and sport should be sponsored by cigarette and alcohol companies. I'd at least remember your face if you were in Lucky Strike leathers.
%
ohnonot: "cloud era"... blahblah blah blah...
%
pvsage about sexynsmartjenny: Wait - she knows 4chan memes?  I think I smell a trap.
%
wuxmedia: Girls... hmm - maybe a typo - Isn't that a gnome-shell dependency?
%
anonymous typo: That makes it feel very much like Win 7/10, if that is your analagy.
%
vrkalak: For my heart, the doctor told me to walk 3 miles every day - that was 2 years ago - now, I don't know where the heck I am.
%
Head_on_a_Stick: Perhaps Putin does not fear the wrath of RMS should he violate the GPL.

pvsage: "In Capitalist Russia, system operates you!"

damo: And NEVER do a search on a work computer for "gimp mask"!
%
martix: BunsenLabs - the slogan free Debian based OS. Hmm, wait...
%
hhh: You need to add ktchen_snk=1 (List of silly kernel parameters)
%
o9000: messing with init is risky. Worst case, it breaks your system, you lose your data including all the family pics and you end up divorced and lonely.
%
hhh: Maybe Disney has gotten hip enough that they won't mind their character quoting awebb. (bringing back the fortune pop-ups feat. Beaker)

Sektor11: You can stick a Lamborghini logo on a VW Bug, but it's still a VW Bug even if you call it a Lamborghini!

Head_on_a_Stick: I've now made more U-turns in this thread than Theresa May...

Head_on_a_Stick: anyway I just copied that bit from the ArchWiki
%
Head_on_a_Stick: Disclaimer: I don't really know the exact nature of this "Whatsapp" and I can't be bothered looking it up.
%
glittersloth: I know that anyone who demands I have one of these revolting messenger apps is someone who I won't have a lasting business or personal relationship with anyway. --- Yeah, I know wearing a condom while having sex with a leper isn't much good, but that's all you can do when everyone in your stinking city has the disease.
